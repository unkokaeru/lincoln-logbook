**What did you learn in the lab tasks this week?**

This week we explored variables and their data types a bit more, as well as how to use inputs and mathematics to prototype a simple calculator.

**How well did I learn it?**

As I already spent last week diving into C++ a lot more, this week was very simple, so I tried to extend the task solutions slightly with error handling etc.

Making great progress so far!

**How does my solution compare with the official solution?**

Task 2.2's first offical solution differs the most by inputting the two numbers in one line, rather than separately.

The second official solution to Task 2.2 is a little bit more different, simplifying the programming techniques used. For example, it doesn't handle any errors and doesn't use a separate functionto handle any calculations.

**How can I extend the concepts used in the tasks to form a new project**

To extend these concepts, I could create a fully functional calculator with verbose error/input handling, which could even be extended to evaluate simple LaTeX expressions.
