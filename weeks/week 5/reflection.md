**What did you learn in the lab tasks this week?**

This week we extended the statements we know with the switch and while statements, then applied those concepts to making an algorithm to find the Babylonian square root.

**How well did I learn it?**

I think I learned everything quite well, borrowing from my understanding of other programming languages really helped, too.

**How does my solution compare with the official solution?**

The offical solutions aren't out yet, but I'll update this when they are - if they are in time for the logbook submission deadline.

**How can I extend the concepts used in the tasks to form a new project**

As similarly suggested in previous weeks, I could extend these concepts to make a fully functional calculator - maybe I will between semesters!
