**What did you learn in the lab tasks this week?**

This lab we covered conditonal statements, input validation, and how we can apply these topics to a simple calculator.

**How well did I learn it?**

It was quite quick to learn everything because of the extra work I've been doing, so yet again, I learned it pretty well!

**How does my solution compare with the official solution?**

Generally, both solutions are the same but mine has more error handling and separates things into more functions. For the final task, the official solution also added another function to be calculated, `sech(x)`, whereas I didn't.

**How can I extend the concepts used in the tasks to form a new project**

I could extend the trigonometric ideas to make a fully functional trig calculator, with various different trigonometric functions to be evaluated.
