**What did you learn in the lab tasks this week?**

We learned more about data types, specifically how they're handled in memory and their sizes. On top of this, we started using the cmath library for more complex calculations.

**How well did I learn it?**

It was quite simple to learn, and interesting to learn more about the lower-level hardware parts, too. It was slightly confusing answering the questions because of a few minor mistakes in the actual questions and example code, but apart from that I learned it all well!

**How does my solution compare with the official solution?**

The official solutions for Task 2.2 are similar to mine, although handled numbers like 1. instead of 1.0 - this seems very confusing to me. It also wrote each expression in one long line, rather than breaking it across multiple with whitespace. The second expression is also incorrectly evaluated as not a real number in the offical solution.

The final part of this week's lab also added more than the question asked for, but so did I with error handling!
