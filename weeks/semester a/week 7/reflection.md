Some questions answers in LAB tasks:

Here are the answers to your questions about pointers and functions in C++:

1. **What is a pointer in C++?**
   A pointer in C++ is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. Pointers are used for dynamic memory allocation, arrays, and for passing large structures or classes to functions efficiently.

2. **How do you declare a pointer in C++?**
   To declare a pointer in C++, you use the asterisk (*) symbol. For example:
   ```cpp
   int* ptr; // Declares a pointer to an integer
   ```

3. **Explain the concept of the "null pointer."**
   A null pointer is a pointer that does not point to any valid memory location. It is often used to indicate that the pointer is not currently assigned to any object or variable. In C++, you can assign a pointer to null using:
   ```cpp
   int* ptr = nullptr; // C++11 and later
   ```

4. **What is the difference between pass-by-value and pass-by-reference in function parameters?**
   - **Pass-by-value** means that a copy of the actual parameter is passed to the function. Changes made to the parameter inside the function do not affect the original argument.
   - **Pass-by-reference** means that a reference (or alias) to the actual parameter is passed to the function. Changes made to the parameter inside the function will affect the original argument.

5. **Define a function in C++ that calculates the factorial of a number using recursion.**
   Here is an example of a recursive function to calculate the factorial:
   ```cpp
   int factorial(int n) {
       if (n <= 1) {
           return 1; // Base case
       }
       return n * factorial(n - 1); // Recursive case
   }
   ```

6. **What is the purpose of the `const` keyword in function declarations?**
   The `const` keyword in function declarations is used to indicate that a parameter or member function will not modify the value of the variable or object it refers to. For example, a `const` parameter prevents the function from changing the argument passed to it, and a `const` member function cannot modify the object's member variables.

7. **How do you return multiple values from a function in C++?**
   You can return multiple values from a function in C++ using several methods:
   - Using `std::pair` or `std::tuple` to return multiple values.
   - Using output parameters (pass-by-reference).
   - Using a struct or class to encapsulate the return values.

   Example using `std::pair`:
   ```cpp
   #include <utility>

   std::pair<int, int> getValues() {
       return std::make_pair(1, 2);
   }
   ```

8. **Explain the difference between `void*` and other pointer types.**
   A `void*` pointer is a special type of pointer that can point to any data type, but it does not have a specific type associated with it. This means you cannot dereference a `void*` pointer directly without casting it to another pointer type. Other pointer types (like `int*`, `char*`, etc.) are strongly typed, meaning they are associated with a specific data type, allowing for direct dereferencing and type-safe operations.
