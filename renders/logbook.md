\newpage## **Week 1** â€“ 2024-09-30 to 2024-10-07

**What did you learn in the lab tasks this week?**

In the lab session this week we focused on outputting to a data stream and handling special characters. In order to output to a data stream, I learned we use `cout` to declare console output and insert data into this with the insertion operator, `<<` - this differs from Python's `print` function, but is essentially how it works. This is because C++ is a lower level language, just above assembly code, and is thus more lightweight and efficient, e.g. you don't need input/output capabilities with all programs, as not all programs need a command-line interface, hence we include the line `#include <iostream>`to access these stream commands.

Additionally, we explored special characters (`\n`, `\a`, `\b`, `\f`, `\r`, and `\t`), escape sequences (`\\`, `\'`, `\"`, and `\?`), and the line terminator (`endl`). The special characters and escape sequences are similar to those used in Python, but the line terminator was completely new for me. Functionally, it seems to act the same as a newline character, but works by ending the data stream started by `cout`.

**How well did I learn it?**

I learned everything pretty quickly, making parallels with Python quite often. It's been really fun learning a completely new, more low-level language and deepening my understanding of programming in general. I did some extra work outside of my lab session, too, which definitely helped me reinforce any new knowledge and understand C++ even quicker.

**How does my solution compare with the official solution?**

There aren't any official solutions right now, so I'll write this next week if they get released.

**How can I extend the concepts used in the tasks to form a new project**

In my extra work this week, I've extended the concepts used to make Pascal's triangle by changing the logic to a more loop-based system so that I can use render any number of rows. I also tried an alternative to using the tab characters, `setd::setw`. Not only this, but I decided to take this number of rows as a user input with `std::cin` and validated the input, throwing an exception if invalid.

I also researched C++ best practices and styling guidelines, referencing documents like Google Style Guides [[1]](#references) and Doxygen [[2]](#references). The main points are learned from this were: consistent comment style (I opted for /* and /**), function return rationale (i.e. when to use `void`), explicitly returning 0 in a main function (to tell the console it ran correctly), docstring placement (before a function, contrasting with Python), and function declaration (placing the opening curly bracket on the same line).

Finally, with the project I already explained, I explored functions, for loops, conditional statements, exception handling, and some basic libraries: `cmath`, `stdexcept`, and `iomanip`.

**Lesson Review Question Answers**

1. Facilitates complex simulations; differs by enabling exploration beyond physical limits.
2. Climate modeling, drug discovery, astrophysics simulations.
3. First computer-assisted proof; raises questions about proof validity.
4. Cost/feasibility issues; safety concerns.
5. From serial to parallel computing; enhances computational power for complex problems.
6. Serial: sequential processing; Parallel: simultaneous processing.
7. Physical limits in miniaturization; heat dissipation, quantum effects.
8. FLOPS: Floating Point Operations Per Second; measures computational performance.
9. Binary: two digits (0, 1); used for electronic circuitry efficiency.
10. Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism.

Multiple choice: BCCBCCBBBA

### Basic Use: Using Cout

#### Task 1.5
The first bit of C++ code I've ever written!

```
cout << "Welcome to C++ Programming\n";
```


### Basic Use: Special Characters

#### Task 1.3
The bell character `\a` makes a sound in some environments.

```
cout << "With bell character: Welcome to C++ Programming\a" << "---\n";
```

The backspace character \b removes the last character.

```
cout << "With backspace character: Welcome to C++ Programming\b" << "---\n";
```

The return character \r returns to the start of the line.

```
cout << "With return character: Welcome to C++ Programming\r" << "---\n";
```

The tab character \t adds a tab space.

```
cout << "With tab character: Welcome to C++ Programming\t" << "---\n";
```

#### Task 1.4
Removing the backslash before the single quote causes a syntax error.

```
cout << "Escaped characters: Is the symbol \\n called \' Newline \' \? \n";
```

#### Task 2.1
The line terminator `endl` starts a new line.

```
cout << "A rose by any other name would smell as sweet";
cout << endl;
```


### Basic Use: Pascals Triangle




```

return 0;
}
```



### Pascal Triangle: Extended Project




```
return 0;
}

**Coursework Question Answers**

1. False, they're stored as binary numbers.
2. Device.
3. `.cpp` extension.
4. Translate source code into machine readable code (or exectuable program) that the computer can run.
5. 8 bits.

7. $15 * 16^5 + 10 * 16^4 + 12 * 16^3 + 10 * 16^2 + 13 * 16^1 + 14 * 16^0 = 16435934$.
8. True.
9. `cout` is used without the namespace `std`, and line 5 is missing a semicolon at the end of the line.
10. Missing the insertion operator on line 8, correct line is `cin >> num1 >> num2;`

### Basic Use: Variables And Data Types

#### Task 1.2
Declare and initalise the variables

```
int total_children = 10;
int candies_per_child = 5;
int extra_candies = 10;
```

Output the starting values and the total number of candies

```
std::cout << "HALLOWEEN CANDY CALCULATOR" << std::endl;
std::cout << "Total Children: " << total_children << std::endl;
std::cout << "Candies per Child: " << candies_per_child << std::endl;
std::cout << "Extra Candies: " << extra_candies << std::endl;
std::cout << "---" << std::endl;
std::cout << "Total Candies: " << total_candies << std::endl;
```

Return 0 to indicate the program ran successfully

```
return 0;
```


### Basic Use: Input And Math

#### Task 2.3
Declare variables to store the masses and distance.

```
float mass1, mass2, distance;
```

We then input the masses and distance.

```
std::cout << "Enter the mass of the first object (kg): ";
std::cin >> mass1;
std::cout << "Enter the mass of the second object (kg): ";
std::cin >> mass2;
std::cout << "Enter the distance between the objects (m): ";
std::cin >> distance;
```

And finally we call the function, catching any exceptions that occur.

```
try {
float force = calculate_gravitational_force(mass1, mass2, distance);
std::cout << "Gravitational Force: " << force << " N" << std::endl;
} catch (std::invalid_argument& error) {
std::cerr << "Error: " << error.what() << std::endl;
}
```




### Coursework: Calculator

#### Task 1.1
Input the radius of the circle.

```
float radius;
input_number(radius, "Enter the radius of the circle: ");
```
Calculate the area and circumference of the circle.

```
float area = M_PI * radius * radius;
float circumference = 2 * M_PI * radius;
std::cout << "Area of a circle with radius " << radius << " = " << area << std::endl;
std::cout << "Circumference of a circle with radius " << radius << " = " << circumference
<< std::endl;
```
#### Task 1.2
Input the principal amount, rate of interest, and time period.

```
float principal, rate, time;
input_number(principal, "Enter the principal amount: ");
input_number(rate, "Enter the rate of interest (%): ");
input_number(time, "Enter the time period (years): ");
```
Calculate the simple interest.

```
float simple_interest = (principal * rate * time) / 100;
std::cout << "Simple Interest on a principal amount of " << principal << " at a rate of "
<< rate << "% for " << time << " years = " << simple_interest << std::endl;
```
