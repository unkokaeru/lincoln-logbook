## **Week 1** â€“ 2024-09-30 to 2024-10-07

**What did you learn in the lab tasks this week?**

In the lab session this week we focused on outputting to a data stream and handling special characters. In order to output to a data stream, I learned we use `cout` to declare console output and insert data into this with the insertion operator, `<<` - this differs from Python's `print` function, but is essentially how it works. This is because C++ is a lower level language, just above assembly code, and is thus more lightweight and efficient, e.g. you don't need input/output capabilities with all programs, as not all programs need a command-line interface, hence we include the line `#include <iostream>`to access these stream commands.

Additionally, we explored special characters (`\n`, `\a`, `\b`, `\f`, `\r`, and `\t`), escape sequences (`\\`, `\'`, `\"`, and `\?`), and the line terminator (`endl`). The special characters and escape sequences are similar to those used in Python, but the line terminator was completely new for me. Functionally, it seems to act the same as a newline character, but works by ending the data stream started by `cout`.

**How well did I learn it?**

I learned everything pretty quickly, making parallels with Python quite often. It's been really fun learning a completely new, more low-level language and deepening my understanding of programming in general. I did some extra work outside of my lab session, too, which definitely helped me reinforce any new knowledge and understand C++ even quicker.

**How does my solution compare with the official solution?**

The official solution for Task 3 adds an additional explanation of how Pascal's triangle is obtained, as well as uses a simplified solution using spaces rather than tab characters.

**How can I extend the concepts used in the tasks to form a new project**

In my extra work this week, I've extended the concepts used to make Pascal's triangle by changing the logic to a more loop-based system so that I can use render any number of rows. I also tried an alternative to using the tab characters, `setd::setw`. Not only this, but I decided to take this number of rows as a user input with `std::cin` and validated the input, throwing an exception if invalid.

I also researched C++ best practices and styling guidelines, referencing documents like Google Style Guides [[1]](#references) and Doxygen [[2]](#references). The main points are learned from this were: consistent comment style (I opted for /* and /**), function return rationale (i.e. when to use `void`), explicitly returning 0 in a main function (to tell the console it ran correctly), docstring placement (before a function, contrasting with Python), and function declaration (placing the opening curly bracket on the same line).

Finally, with the project I already explained, I explored functions, for loops, conditional statements, exception handling, and some basic libraries: `cmath`, `stdexcept`, and `iomanip`.

**Lesson Review Question Answers**

1. Facilitates complex simulations; differs by enabling exploration beyond physical limits.
2. Climate modeling, drug discovery, astrophysics simulations.
3. First computer-assisted proof; raises questions about proof validity.
4. Cost/feasibility issues; safety concerns.
5. From serial to parallel computing; enhances computational power for complex problems.
6. Serial: sequential processing; Parallel: simultaneous processing.
7. Physical limits in miniaturization; heat dissipation, quantum effects.
8. FLOPS: Floating Point Operations Per Second; measures computational performance.
9. Binary: two digits (0, 1); used for electronic circuitry efficiency.
10. Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism.

### Basic Use: Using Cout

#### Task 1.5
The first bit of C++ code I've ever written!

```
cout << "Welcome to C++ Programming\n";
```


### Basic Use: Special Characters

#### Task 2.3
The bell character `\a` makes a sound in some environments.

```
cout << "With bell character: Welcome to C++ Programming\a" << "---\n";
```

The backspace character \b removes the last character.

```
cout << "With backspace character: Welcome to C++ Programming\b" << "---\n";
```

The return character \r returns to the start of the line.

```
cout << "With return character: Welcome to C++ Programming\r" << "---\n";
```

The tab character \t adds a tab space.

```
cout << "With tab character: Welcome to C++ Programming\t" << "---\n";
```

#### Task 2.4
Removing the backslash before the single quote causes a syntax error.

```
cout << "Escaped characters: Is the symbol \\n called \' Newline \' \? \n";
```

#### Task 2.5
The line terminator `endl` starts a new line.

```
cout << "A rose by any other name would smell as sweet";
cout << endl;
```

## **Week 2** â€“ 2024-10-07 to 2024-10-14

**What did you learn in the lab tasks this week?**

This week we explored variables and their data types a bit more, as well as how to use inputs and mathematics to prototype a simple calculator.

**How well did I learn it?**

As I already spent last week diving into C++ a lot more, this week was very simple, so I tried to extend the task solutions slightly with error handling etc.

Making great progress so far!

**How does my solution compare with the official solution?**

Task 2.2's first offical solution differs the most by inputting the two numbers in one line, rather than separately.

The second official solution to Task 2.2 is a little bit more different, simplifying the programming techniques used. For example, it doesn't handle any errors and doesn't use a separate functionto handle any calculations.

**How can I extend the concepts used in the tasks to form a new project**

To extend these concepts, I could create a fully functional calculator with verbose error/input handling, which could even be extended to evaluate simple LaTeX expressions.

### Basic Use: Variables And Data Types

#### Task 1.2
Declare and initalise the variables

```
int total_children = 10;
int candies_per_child = 5;
int extra_candies = 10;
```

Output the starting values and the total number of candies

```
std::cout << "HALLOWEEN CANDY CALCULATOR" << std::endl;
std::cout << "Total Children: " << total_children << std::endl;
std::cout << "Candies per Child: " << candies_per_child << std::endl;
std::cout << "Extra Candies: " << extra_candies << std::endl;
std::cout << "---" << std::endl;
std::cout << "Total Candies: " << total_candies << std::endl;
```

Return 0 to indicate the program ran successfully

```
return 0;
```


### Basic Use: Input And Math

#### Task 2.1
Calculate the quotient on top of the given code for completion.

```
result = number1 / number2;
std::cout << "Quotient: " << result << std::endl;
```

#### Task 2.3
Declare variables to store the masses and distance.

```
float mass1, mass2, distance;
```

We then input the masses and distance.

```
std::cout << "Enter the mass of the first object (kg): ";
std::cin >> mass1;
std::cout << "Enter the mass of the second object (kg): ";
std::cin >> mass2;
std::cout << "Enter the distance between the objects (m): ";
std::cin >> distance;
```

And finally we call the function, catching any exceptions that occur.

```
try {
float force = calculate_gravitational_force(mass1, mass2, distance);
std::cout << "Gravitational Force: " << force << " N" << std::endl;
} catch (std::invalid_argument& error) {
std::cerr << "Error: " << error.what() << std::endl;
}
```




### Coursework: Calculator

#### Task 1.1
Input the radius of the circle.

```
float radius;
input_number(radius, "Enter the radius of the circle: ");
```
Calculate the area and circumference of the circle.

```
float area = M_PI * radius * radius;
float circumference = 2 * M_PI * radius;
std::cout << "Area of a circle with radius " << radius << " = " << area << std::endl;
std::cout << "Circumference of a circle with radius " << radius << " = " << circumference
<< std::endl;
```
#### Task 1.2
Input the principal amount, rate of interest, and time period.

```
float principal, rate, time;
input_number(principal, "Enter the principal amount: ");
input_number(rate, "Enter the rate of interest (%): ");
input_number(time, "Enter the time period (years): ");
```
Calculate the simple interest.

```
float simple_interest = (principal * rate * time) / 100;
std::cout << "Simple Interest on a principal amount of " << principal << " at a rate of "
<< rate << "% for " << time << " years = " << simple_interest << std::endl;
```
#### Task 2.1
False, they are stored as binary numbers.

```
return 0;
}


```
#### Task 2.2
Device.

```

```
#### Task 2.3
`.cpp` extension.

```

```
#### Task 2.4
Translate source code into machine readable code (or exectuable program) that the computer can run.

```

```
#### Task 2.5
8 bits.

```

```
#### Task 2.6
Hexadecimal (base 16).

```

```
#### Task 2.7
$15 * 16^5 + 10 * 16^4 + 12 * 16^3 + 10 * 16^2 + 13 * 16^1 + 14 * 16^0 = 16435934$.

```

```
#### Task 2.8
True.

```

```
#### Task 2.9
`cout` is used without the namespace `std`, and line 5 is missing a semicolon at the end of the line.

```

```
#### Task 2.10
Missing the insertion operator on line 8, correct line is `cin >> num1 >> num2;`

```

```

## **Week 3** â€“ 2024-10-14 to 2024-10-21

**What did you learn in the lab tasks this week?**

We learned more about data types, specifically how they're handled in memory and their sizes. On top of this, we started using the cmath library for more complex calculations.

**How well did I learn it?**

It was quite simple to learn, and interesting to learn more about the lower-level hardware parts, too. It was slightly confusing answering the questions because of a few minor mistakes in the actual questions and example code, but apart from that I learned it all well!

**How does my solution compare with the official solution?**

The official solutions for Task 2.2 are similar to mine, although handled numbers like 1. instead of 1.0 - this seems very confusing to me. It also wrote each expression in one long line, rather than breaking it across multiple with whitespace. The second expression is also incorrectly evaluated as not a real number in the offical solution.

The final part of this week's lab also added more than the question asked for, but so did I with error handling!

### Basic Use: Data Size

#### Task 1.1
After reaching the max value of the data type, the number goes to zero.

```
std::cout << "Original number: " << unsigned_small_number << std::endl;
unsigned_small_number++;
std::cout << "Incremented number (1x): " << unsigned_small_number << std::endl;
unsigned_small_number++;
std::cout << "Incremented number (2x): " << unsigned_small_number << std::endl;
```

#### Task 1.3
Similar to overflow, it loops around as an underflow.

```
signed_small_number = -32768;
std::cout << "Original number: " << signed_small_number << std::endl;
signed_small_number--;
std::cout << "Decremented number (1x): " << signed_small_number << std::endl;
signed_small_number--;
std::cout << "Decremented number (2x): " << signed_small_number << std::endl;
```


### Libraries: Using Cmath

#### Task 2.1
Calculate the square root of 9.0, which resulted in 3.

```
std::cout << sqrt(9.0) << std::endl;
```

Calculate the natural logarithm of 1.1, which resulted in 0.0953102.

```
std::cout << log(1.1) << std::endl;
```

Calculate 2.5 raised to the power of 3.0, which resulted in 15.625.

```
std::cout << pow(2.5, 3.0) << std::endl;
```

Calculate the ceiling of 4.1, which resulted in 5.

```
std::cout << ceil(4.1) << std::endl;
```

Calculate (7 + sqrt(7.0)) / 3.0, which resulted in 3.21525.

```
std::cout << (7 + sqrt(7.0)) / 3.0 << std::endl;
```

Calculate the hyperbolic tan of 0.342, which resulted in 0.329262

```
std::cout << tanh(0.342) << std::endl;
```

Calculate the remainder of 11.0 divided by 4.0, which resulted in 3.

```
std::cout << fmod(11.0, 4.0) << std::endl;
```

Calculate the absolute value of -9, which resulted in 9.

```
std::cout << abs(-9) << std::endl;
```

Calculate the (floating) absolute value of -4.5, which resulted in 4.5.

```
std::cout << fabs(-4.5) << std::endl;
```

Calculate the floor of 8.8, which resulted in 8.

```
std::cout << floor(8.8) << std::endl;
```

Calculate the base-10 logarithm of 1.0, which resulted in 0.

```
std::cout << log10(1.0) << std::endl;
```

Calculate the cube root of 10.0, which resulted in 2.15443.

```
std::cout << cbrt(10.0) << std::endl;
```

#### Task 2.3
Prompt the user for a value of x.

```
double x;
std::cout << "Calculation of the hyperbolic cosecant function..." << std::endl;
std::cout << "Enter a value for x: ";
std::cin >> x;
```

Calculate the hyperbolic cosecant of x using the custom csch function.

```
double y = csch(x);
if (!std::isnan(y)) {
std::cout << "Hyperbolic cosecant of " << x << " is: " << y << std::endl;
} else {
std::cout << "Hyperbolic cosecant is undefined for x = 0." << std::endl;
}
```




### Coursework: Trig Calculator

#### Task 3.0
Start with a verbose number input function to re-use.

```
void input_number(double& number, const std::string& input_message) {
while (true) {
std::cout << input_message;
std::cin >> number;

if (std::cin.fail()) {
std::cerr << "Invalid input. Please enter a valid number." << std::endl;
std::cin.clear();
std::cin.ignore(std::numeric_limits<std::streamsize>::max(), '\n');
} else {
std::cin.ignore(std::numeric_limits<std::streamsize>::max(), '\n');
return;
}
}
}
```
Implement the main program loop with the atanh and acosh functions.

```
int main() {
while (true) {
double choice;
std::cout << "Select an operation:\n1. Inverse Hyperbolic Tangent\n"
<< "2. Inverse Hyperbolic Cosine\n0. Exit\n";
input_number(choice, "Enter your choice: ");

if (choice == 0) {
break;
}

double x;

## **Week 4** â€“ 2024-10-21 to 2024-10-28

**What did you learn in the lab tasks this week?**

This lab we covered conditonal statements, input validation, and how we can apply these topics to a simple calculator.

**How well did I learn it?**

It was quite quick to learn everything because of the extra work I've been doing, so yet again, I learned it pretty well!

**How does my solution compare with the official solution?**

Generally, both solutions are the same but mine has more error handling and separates things into more functions. For the final task, the official solution also added another function to be calculated, `sech(x)`, whereas I didn't.

**How can I extend the concepts used in the tasks to form a new project**

I could extend the trigonometric ideas to make a fully functional trig calculator, with various different trigonometric functions to be evaluated.

### Control Structures: If Else Statements

#### Task 1.1
Copy the function to calculate the first piecewise function.

```
std::tuple<double, double> evaluate_function1(double x, double &y) {
if (x >= 2) {
std::cout << "x is greater than or equal to 2, so \n";
std::cout << "y = x^3 + sqrt(x) = ";
y = pow(x, 3) + sqrt(x);
} else if (x > 0.5 && x < 2) {
std::cout << "x is between 0.5 and 2, so \n";
std::cout << "y = 1 - exp(x) = ";
y = 1 - exp(x);
} else {
std::cout << "x is less than or equal to 0.5, so \n";
std::cout << "y = |x + 5| = ";
y = fabs(x + 5);
}

return std::make_tuple(x, y);
}
```

#### Task 1.3
Evaluate the second piecewise function.

```
std::tuple<double, double> evaluate_function2(double x, double &y) {
if (x < -M_PI/2) {
std::cout << "x is less than -pi/2, so \n";
std::cout << "y = -1 - pi/2 = ";
y = -1 - M_PI/2;
} else if (x >= -M_PI/2 && x <= 0) {
std::cout << "x is between -pi/2 and 0, so \n";
std::cout << "y = sin(x) + x = ";
y = sin(x) + x;
} else {
std::cout << "x is greater than 0, so \n";
std::cout << "y = x = ";
y = x;
}

return std::make_tuple(x, y);
}
```


### Control Structures: Input Validation

#### Task 2.0
Initalises the constant variables.

```
const double banned_number = 2.0;
const double small_number = 10e-12;
```

Fetch input from the user.

```
double x;
std::cout << "Enter a value for x (other than 2.0): ";
std::cin >> x;
```

Calculate the function and output the result.

```
cout << "When x = " << x << ", the function y = 1/(x^2 - 2) is equal to ";
double y = 1 / (std::pow(x, 2.0) - 2.0);
cout << y << endl;
```


### Control Structures: Simple Calculator

#### Task 3.0
Create a function to input a number, avoiding a banned number.

```
void input_number(const std::string &input_message, double &number, const double &banned_number){
const double float_error_resolution = 10e-12;

while (true){
std::cout << input_message;
std::cin >> number;

if (std::cin.fail()){
std::cerr << "Invalid input. Please enter a valid number." << std::endl;
std::cin.clear();
std::cin.ignore(std::numeric_limits<std::streamsize>::max(), '\n');
} else if (std::fabs(number - banned_number) < float_error_resolution){
std::cerr << "Error: x cannot be " << banned_number << std::endl;
std::cin.clear();
std::cin.ignore(std::numeric_limits<std::streamsize>::max(), '\n');
} else {
std::cin.ignore(std::numeric_limits<std::streamsize>::max(), '\n');
return;
}
}
}
```

Loop selection until the user exits.

```
while (true) {
std::cout << "List of functions:" << std::endl;
std::cout << "0. Exit" << std::endl;
std::cout << "1. csch(x)" << std::endl;

int choice;
std::cout << "Enter the number of the function you would like to use: ";
std::cin >> choice;
std::cin.ignore(std::numeric_limits<std::streamsize>::max(), '\n');
std::cout << "---" << std::endl;

double x, y;
switch (choice){
case 0:
std::cout << "Exiting..." << std::endl;
return 0;
case 1:
input_number("Enter x: ", x, 0.0);
std::cout << "csch(" << x << ") = ";
y = 1.0 / std::sinh(x);
break;
default:
std::cerr << "Invalid choice. Please enter a valid number." << std::endl;
y = NAN;
break;
}

if (!std::isnan(y)){
std::cout << y << std::endl;
}
}
```




### Coursework: Quadratic Calculator

#### Task 5.0
Include the necessary libraries.

```
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
#include <limits>
#include <tuple>
```
Start with a verbose number input function to re-use.

```
void input_number(double& number, const std::string& input_message) {
while (true) {
std::cout << input_message;
std::cin >> number;

if (std::cin.fail()) {
std::cerr << "Invalid input. Please enter a valid number." << std::endl;
std::cin.clear();
std::cin.ignore(std::numeric_limits<std::streamsize>::max(), '\n');
} else {
std::cin.ignore(std::numeric_limits<std::streamsize>::max(), '\n');
return;
}
}
}
```
Calculate the quadratic's solution.

```
std::tuple<double, double> solve_quadratic(const double a, const double b, const double c) {
double discriminant = pow(b, 2) - 4 * a * c;
if (discriminant < 0) {
return std::make_tuple(NAN, NAN);
}

double x1 = (-b + sqrt(discriminant)) / (2 * a);
double x2 = (-b - sqrt(discriminant)) / (2 * a);

return std::make_tuple(x1, x2);
}
```
Implement the main program loop.

```
int main() {
while (true) {
double a, b, c;
input_number(a, "Enter the coefficient of x^2: ");
input_number(b, "Enter the coefficient of x: ");
input_number(c, "Enter the constant term: ");

std::tuple<double, double> x = solve_quadratic(a, b, c);

std::cout << "The quadratic equation " << a << "x^2 + " << b << "x + " << c << " = 0 has ";

if (std::isnan(std::get<0>(x))) {
std::cout << "no real solutions." << std::endl;
} else if (std::get<0>(x) == std::get<1>(x)) {
std::cout << "one solution: x = " << std::get<0>(x)
<< std::endl;
} else {
std::cout << "two solutions: x = " << std::get<0>(x)
<< " and x = " << std::get<1>(x) << std::endl;
}

char response;
std::cout << "Would you like to solve another quadratic equation? (y/n): ";
std::cin >> response;

if (response != 'y') {
break;
}
}

return 0;
}
```

## **Week 5** â€“ 2024-10-28 to 2024-11-04

**What did you learn in the lab tasks this week?**

This week we extended the statements we know with the switch and while statements, then applied those concepts to making an algorithm to find the Babylonian square root.

**How well did I learn it?**

I think I learned everything quite well, borrowing from my understanding of other programming languages really helped, too.

**How does my solution compare with the official solution?**

The offical solutions aren't out yet, but I'll update this when they are - if they are in time for the logbook submission deadline.

**How can I extend the concepts used in the tasks to form a new project**

As similarly suggested in previous weeks, I could extend these concepts to make a fully functional calculator - maybe I will between semesters!

### Control Structures: Switch Statements

#### Task 1.1
Example switch statement.

```
void example_switch_function() {
unsigned int incrementor = 3;
unsigned int number;

switch (incrementor) {
case 1:
number = 1;
break;
case 2:
number = 1;
break;
case 3:
number = 2;
break;
case 4:
number = 6;
break;
case 5:
number = 24;
break;
default:
number = 0;
break;
}

std::cout << "The number is: " << number << std::endl;
}
```

Call the example switch function.

```
// example_switch_function(); // uncomment this line to run the example
```

#### Task 1.2
Implement a switch statement to select a function.

```

const double small_number = 10e-12;
double x, y;
int selection;

std::cout << "FUNCTION LIST" << std::endl;
std::cout << "1. csch(x)" << std::endl;
std::cout << "2. sech(x)" << std::endl;
std::cout << "3. coth(x)" << std::endl;

std::cout << "Select a function (1-3): ";
std::cin >> selection;
if (selection > 0 && selection < 4) {
std::cout << "Enter a value for x: ";
std::cin >> x;
std::cout << "For x = " << x << ", ";
}

switch (selection) {
case 1:
if (std::abs(x) < small_number) {
std::cout << "csch(x) is undefined for x = 0." << std::endl;
return 1;
}
y = 1/sinh(x);
std::cout << "csch(x) ";
break;
case 2:
y = 1/cosh(x);
std::cout << "sech(x) ";
break;
case 3:
if (std::abs(x) < small_number) {
std::cout << "coth(x) is undefined for x = 0." << std::endl;
return 1;
}
y = 1/tanh(x);
std::cout << "coth(x) ";
break;
default:
std::cout << "Invalid selection." << std::endl;
return 1;
}

std::cout << "= " << y << std::endl;
```


### Control Structures: While Loops

#### Task 2.1
The precision is set to 10 decimal places.

```
std::setprecision(10);
```

The mean is calculated by dividing the sum by the number of values.

```
double mean = sum / 6;
```

Calculate the variance and hence standard deviation.

```
double variance = ((sum_of_squares / 6) - (mean * mean)) * 6 / 5;
double standard_deviation = std::sqrt(variance);
```

The calculated values are then outputted to the console.

```
std::cout << "The minimum value is: " << min << std::endl;
std::cout << "The maximum value is: " << max << std::endl;
std::cout << "The mean value is: " << mean << std::endl;
std::cout << "The standard deviation is: " << standard_deviation << std::endl;
```

#### Task 2.2
The factorial is calculated using a do-while loop.

```
do {
factorial_result *= current_number;
current_number++;
} while (current_number <= input_number);
```

The calculated factorial is outputted to the console.

```
std::cout << "The factorial of " << input_number << " is: " << factorial_result << std::endl;
```


### Algorithms: Babylonian Square Root

#### Task 3.1
The user is prompted to input a number.

```
double number = 0;
std::cout << "Enter a number: ";
std::cin >> number;
```

The square root is calculated and outputted to the console.

```
double square_root = babylonian_square_root(number);
std::cout << "The square root of " << number << " is " << square_root << std::endl;
```




### Coursework: Variable Manipulation

#### Task 6.0
Include the necessary libraries.

```
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
```
#### Task 6.1
Declare the variables with their respective data types.

```
int x = 25;
int y = 18;
double pay_rate = 12.50;
int first_number = 10;
int temporary_number = first_number;
```
#### Task 6.2
Swap the values of x and y using a temporary variable.

```
int temporary_x = x;
x = y;
y = temporary_x;
```
#### Task 6.3
Output the values of x and y and evaluate the expression.

```
std::cout << "The value of x is: " << x << std::endl;
std::cout << "The value of y is: " << y << std::endl;
double evaluated_expression = (x + 12) / (y - 18 + pow(x, 3)); // Unsure if correct expression
std::cout << "Substituting these values into the expression (x + 12) / (y - 18 + x^3) gives: "
<< evaluated_expression << std::endl;
```
